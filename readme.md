##Capstone Project - Analysis of Climate Change##

This report provides an analysis and evaluation of the current research in climate change, investigating the factors involved in the causes and the corresponding planet-wide atmospheric, agricultural, and oceanic effects.

Methods of analysis include univariate data visualisation and linear regression on the various datasets collected.

The results of the analysis show that the causes of climate change, the man-caused release of greenhouse-causing gases into the atmosphere have reached levels never-before-seen in the measurable history of the planet. As a result, the effects measured such as inceased sea levels and atmospheric temperatures, and land ice mass reductions, have steadily increased to present damaging levels.

This report finds that the theory of man-caused climate change is indeed a probable phenomenon based on the data collected worldwide, and suggests further analysis and actions to be taken by all world governments to curb and possibly reverse the catastrophic end result of a runaway greenhouse effect.
