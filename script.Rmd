# General Notes about the code
# -----------------------------------
# 1) The Try-Catch blocks are only necessary for live data sources pulled from
#   the internet directly, whereby the validity of the data cannot be
#   guaranteed at runtime. They are still left in the code below even though
#   the data sources are being loaded locally.
# 2) All code chunks follow the same pattern as defined by the following
#   pseudocode:
#   - Set data source filename
#   - Run Load_data function, passing through filename, and returning loaded
#     dataframe
#   - Run 'cleanup' munging function, passing through dataframe
#   - Run ggplot block, passing through dataframe

# Executive Summary

This report provides an analysis and evaluation of the current research in climate change, investigating the factors involved in the causes and the corresponding planet-wide atmospheric, agricultural, and oceanic effects.

Methods of analysis include univariate data visualisation and linear regression on the various datasets collected.

The results of the analysis show that the causes of climate change, the man-caused release of greenhouse-causing gases into the atmosphere have reached levels never-before-seen in the measurable history of the planet. As a result, the effects measured such as increased sea levels and atmospheric temperatures, and land ice mass reductions, have steadily increased to present damaging levels.

This report finds that the theory of man-caused climate change is indeed a probable phenomenon based on the data collected worldwide, and suggests further analysis and actions to be taken by all world governments to curb and possibly reverse the catastrophic end result of a runaway greenhouse effect.

# Introduction

The year 2016 proved to be quite tumultuous for the Earth's climate. In January, Hurricane Pali, was earliest hurricane on record in the central Pacific basin. In February, Tropical cyclone Winston was the strongest storm to hit Fiji since records began. In March, Melbourne Australia experienced the hottest March night since records began. In April, Houston Texas endured the second wettest calendar day on record. In May, the wildfire that broke out in Fort McMurray, Canada, was the most costly fire in Canada’s history, forcing nearly 90,000 people to evacuate the town.[^1]

June saw Paris suffer such a large rainfall that the River Seine water levels rise to the highest in thirty years, causing severe flooding. July saw the highest temperature ever recorded in the Eastern Hemisphere (54°C) in Mitribah.[^2] The rest of the year experienced the same astonishing climate aberrations month after month.

In 1900, Swedish scientist Knut Angstrom discovers that CO~2~ strongly absorbs parts of the infrared spectrum, even at the minuscule concentrations in the atmosphere. In effect, Angstrom had shown that a trace gas can produce greenhouse warming, although he was not aware of the significance of his finding at the time.[^3] Just 38 years later, British engineer Guy Callendar found that atmospheric temperatures had risen compared to the previous century, using measurements from 147 weather stations around the world. He also observed that CO~2~ concentrations had increased over the same period, and presciently suggested that this actually caused the observed warming. The "Callendar effect", unfortunately, was widely dismissed by meteorologists at the time.[^4]

Today, a cultural and political battle is being waged worldwide between two distinct camps: Those who believe that the scientific community's observations and general consensus of a change in the Earth's climate and the increase in the atmosphere's temperature caused by the increase of greenhouse gases from human activity, and those who don't.

# Causes of Climate Change

The general consensus amongst climate scientists is that the main cause of the current global warming trend is human expansion of the "greenhouse effect" — warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.[^20] The greenhouse effect itself is a natural phenomenon which is the trapping of solar heat in the atmosphere using atmospheric gases. It is this warming of our atmosphere which has allowed all life on Earth to exist and thrive.

Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as "forcing" climate change. Gases, such as water vapour, which respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are seen as "feedback".

The main gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect are the following: Water vapour, Carbon dioxide, Methane, Nitrous oxide, and Halogenated gases (which include chlorofluorocarbons). Out of all these gases, water vapour concentrations are actually affected by greenhouse effect cause by the others. So as the Earth's atmosphere heats up, more of the ocean is evaporated, increasing the concentration of water vapour, hence why it is considered an important feedback mechanism.[^21]

Over the last century, the increase in the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil has pumped more carbon into the atmosphere. The carbon, which bonds with atmospheric oxygen, produces carbon dioxide, and has increased the concentration of atmospheric CO~2~.

The data behind these greenhouse gases will be explored in the following sections.

## Greenhouse Gases
### Global Atmospheric Concentrations of Carbon Dioxide Over Time | Years 800,000 BCE to 2015 CE 
https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-atmospheric-concentrations-greenhouse-gases

The main argument for climate change revolves around the increase in the atmosphere's carbon dioxide (CO~2~) concentrations. The scientific model for climate change indicates that main cause of the current global warming trend is human expansion of the "greenhouse effect" - warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.[^5]

CO~2~ is naturally released into the atmosphere from animal respiration and volcanic eruptions. Humans have increased CO~2~ release through deforestation, land use changes, and burning of fossil fuels.[^6]

87 percent of all human-produced carbon dioxide emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, natural gas and oil. The remainder results from the clearing of forests and other land use changes (9%), as well as some industrial processes such as cement manufacturing (4%).[^7]

The largest human source of carbon dioxide emissions is from the combustion of fossil fuels. Burning these fuels releases energy which is most commonly turned into heat, electricity or power for transportation. Some examples of where they are used are in power plants, cars, planes and industrial facilities. In 2011, fossil fuel use created 33.2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide.[^8]

The 3 types of fossil fuels that are used the most are coal, natural gas and oil. Coal is responsible for 43% of carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion, 36% is produced by oil and 20% from natural gas.[^9]

Coal is the most carbon intensive fossil fuel. For every tonne of coal burned, approximately 2.5 tonnes of CO~2~ are produced. Of all the different types of fossil fuels, coal produces the most carbon dioxide. Because of this and its high rate of use, coal is the largest fossil fuel source of carbon dioxide emissions. Coal represents one-third of fossil fuels' share of world total primary energy supply but is responsible for 43% of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use.[^10]

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Canada | 136.31 | 622.98 | 21.9% |
| France | 44.65 | 532.57 | 8.4% |

Carbon dioxide (CO~2~) is nearly transparent to the solar radiation emitted from the sun, but partially opaque to the thermal radiation emitted by the earth.  As such, it allows incoming solar radiation from the sun to pass through it and warm the earth's surface.  The earth's surface, in turn, emits a portion of this energy upwards toward space as longer wavelength or thermal radiation.  Some of this thermal radiation is absorbed and re-radiated by the atmosphere's CO~2~ molecules back toward earth's surface, providing an additional source of heat energy.[^12]

Using ice core samples for ancient measurements, the plot of the atmospheric concentrations of CO~2~ from 800,000 BCE to 2015 CE show a natural cycle over time, which repeats quite consistently over the period. Due to the earth's irregular axial rotation and elliptical orbit around the sun, the varying distribution of solar energy hitting the planet causes cold periods known as "ice ages". These ice ages occur roughly every 100,000 years. During an ice age, a portion of the atmospheric CO~2~ is trapped in frozen ice. It is released again when the ice thaws.[^34]

The break in the cycle occurred in 1909, when the atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations increased past 298.6 parts per million (ppm), which was the maximum concentration measured from the entire period until that year (actually measured for the year 330,969 BCE). From 1909 until present day, the concentration has continued to rise ceaselessly, and is currently at 400.83 ppm for the year 2015.

The scientific reasoning behind this observation is that the human industrial activities outlined above have finally expended more CO~2~ into the atmosphere than the Earth's natural carbon cycle can process, leading to a runaway 'Greenhouse Effect' which is leading to the catastrophic effects listed in the following section.[^37]

https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-atmospheric-concentrations-greenhouse-gases

Methane is a gas that is naturally emitted by natural sources such as wetlands, as well as human activities such as leakage from natural gas systems and the raising of livestock. Methane's lifetime in the atmosphere is much shorter than CO~2~'s, however it is up to 25 times more efficient than CO~2~ in retaining heat in the atmosphere. As the food livestock industry grows to accommodate an ever-expanding human population, the output of methane from animal waste alone is causing a sharp rise in methane in the atmosphere. The concentration of methane in the atmosphere has more than doubled since pre-industrial times.[^13]

The plot below shows the concentration of methane in the atmosphere from 800,000 BCE to 2015 CE, using ice core samples for ancient measurements. The pattern shows a natural cycle over time, which repeats quite consistently over the period. The break in the cycle occurred in 1871, when the atmospheric methane concentrations increased past 798.2 parts per billion (ppb), which was the maximum concentration measured from the entire period until that year (actually measured for the year 330,925 BCE). From 1871 until present day, the concentration has continued to rise ceaselessly, and is currently at 1819.16 ppb for the year 2015.

### Global Atmospheric Concentrations of Nitrous Oxide Over Time | Years 800,000 BCE to 2015 CE 
https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-atmospheric-concentrations-greenhouse-gases

Nitrous oxide (NO) is naturally present in the atmosphere as part of the Earth's nitrogen cycle, and has a variety of natural sources, such as soils under natural vegetation and the oceans. Natural sources create 62% of total emissions.[^14]

From the beginning of the industrial age until present day, human activities have nearly doubled the natural levels of NO in the atmosphere. In 2015, nitrous oxide (NO) accounted for about 5 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from human activities.[^15]

Activities such as agriculture, fossil fuel combustion, wastewater management, and industrial processes are increasing the amount of NO in the atmosphere. Nitrous oxide molecules stay in the atmosphere for an average of 114 years before being removed by a sink or destroyed through chemical reactions. The impact of NO on warming the atmosphere is almost 300 times that of CO~2~.[^16]

### Global Atmospheric Concentrations of Selected Halogenated Gases Over Time | Years 1978 to 2015
https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-atmospheric-concentrations-greenhouse-gases

Halogenated gases are a class of ethers that contain halogen atoms such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine, in substitute of hydrogen atoms.[^17] Halogen atoms are highly reactive, and as such can be harmful or lethal to biological organisms in sufficient quantities. Fluorine is one of the most reactive elements, attacking otherwise-inert materials such as glass, and forming compounds with the usually inert noble gases.[^18]

Fluorinated gases are used inside of products like refrigerators, air-conditioners, foams and aerosol cans. Emissions from these products are caused by gas leakage during the manufacturing process as well as throughout the product's life. Fluorinated gases are also used for the production of metals and semiconductors.[^19]

The plots below show an interesting trend in comparison to the previously-analysed greenhouse gases: From the starting measurement year of 1978 there were minimal traces of each in the atmosphere, then each of the 5 gases measured increased in concentration drastically. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC12) and Halon-1211 began to decrease in concentration from 2005 onwards. Methyl Chloroform decreased substantially from 1993 to a concentration close to 0 parts per trillion (ppt). HCFC-22 and HCFC-141b have steadily and linearly increased since the starting year of measurements.

## Deforestation

According to current research, deforestation in tropical rainforests adds more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than the sum total of cars and trucks on the world’s roads. According to the World Carfree Network (WCN), cars and trucks account for about 14 percent of global carbon emissions, while most analysts attribute upwards of 15 percent to deforestation.[^29]

Trees play a huge role in the carbon cycle. They convert the CO~2~ in the air to oxygen, through the process of photosynthesis, and in this way, they can be looked at as a natural regulator of the carbon dioxide. The more trees, the less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the more oxygen.[^30]

Deforestation compounds the effects of climate change by reducing efficacy of the very mechanism that removes the natural levels of CO~2~ from the atmosphere, let alone the increased levels caused by human industrial activity.

The core variable at the heart of the study of climate change is the planet's atmospheric temperature. The following plot, using a dataset received from the World Bank Climate Change Portal, shows the average yearly temperature for the time period between 1990 to 2015. The line bar on the plot shows continuous fluctuations of the average temperature between years, and an overall increase over the entire period.

## GDP

As discussed in section 3.2.1 above, 87 percent of all human-produced carbon dioxide emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, natural gas and oil. Two factors that measure the commercial activity of a nation state are the Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, and Industrialisation Intensity Index.

The Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, is a monetary measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced in a period[^32] (yearly, in this dataset). The cause of a rise in a nation's GDP is the increase in the production of said good and services, which includes industrial processes and outputs. This industrial output, combined with consumer activities, generate climate-changing CO~2~ emissions.

This document will specifically use the GDP to measure the commercial activity of a nation state to attempt to correlate man-made activity with global atmospheric CO~2~, CO~2~ emissions, and atmospheric temperature trends.

Carbon dioxide emissions are those stemming from the burning of fossil fuels and the manufacture of cement. They include carbon dioxide produced during consumption of solid, liquid, and gas fuels and gas flaring[^36]. This measurement of CO~2~ is a direct indicator of human activity which contributes to the greenhouse effect, causing climate change. The plot below shows a steady increase in CO~2~ emissions over the time period between 1990 to 2015. The data used is derived from a subset of the same dataset used in section 3.2.1 above

As explained in section 3.2.1 above, 87 percent of all human-produced carbon dioxide emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, natural gas and oil. The consumption of these fuels is mainly driven by commercial activity, and thus _GDP_ can be a good measure to compare to _Atmospheric CO~2~_.

The following plot of _GDP_ vs _Atmospheric CO~2~_ shows a strong visual correlation between these two variables, as an increase in _GDP_ correlates with an increase in _Atmospheric CO~2~_. The Pearson correlation estimate is `r toString(format(round(gdp_atmospheric_co2_all_countries_cor$estimate, 2), nsmall = 2))`, with a p-value of `r toString(format(gdp_atmospheric_co2_all_countries_cor$p.value, digits = 3, scientific = TRUE))`, which validates the strong correlation shown in the plot.

From this analysis, it is possible that the commercial activities that drive _GDP_ up are a reasonably strong contributing factor of increased _Atmospheric CO~2~_.

The following plot of _GDP_ vs _Temperature_ shows a very weak visual correlation between these two variables over the given time period, as the _GDP_ value doesn't seem to evenly correlate with an increase in _Temperature._ In fact, both low and high _GDP_ levels equate with high _Temperature_ measurements. The Pearson correlation estimate is `r toString(format(round(gdp_temperature_all_countries_cor$estimate, 2), nsmall = 2))`, with a p-value of `r toString(format(round(gdp_temperature_all_countries_cor$p.value, 2), nsmall = 2))`, which validates the weak correlation shown in the plot. This is probably due to the large fluctuations in the temperature data year-to-year, which smooth out and form a more linear increasing gradient over a much larger time period of a century or more years.

From this analysis, for the given time period, it can be estimated that _GDP_ is a very weak predictor of _Atmospheric Temperature_.

# Effects of Climate Change

## Global Mean Estimates Based on Land-Surface Air Temperature Anomalies Only (Meteorological Station Data, dTs)
http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/

In section 3.3.3 above, global temperature trend from the World Bank Data Portal for the time period 1990 to 2015 was plotted and compared to other possible climate change-causing factors. A temperature dataset from NASA contains detailed measurements from 1880 is used in this section to show a longer historical view of the earth's constantly-increasing atmospheric temperatures, which is the climate change topic's main factor of proof.

Global surface temperature data sets are an essential resource for monitoring and understanding climate variability and climate change. This dataset combines historical observations of near surface air temperatures at land stations with global data sets of sea surface temperatures (SST) obtained from a changing mix of ship-based and buoy measurements.[^22]

This plot illustrates the change in global land-surface air temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2016. An anomaly in this case is a departure from a reference value or long-term average. Due to the difficulty in collecting accurate absolute temperature measurements around the world (eg. due to few temperature measurement stations at certain locations, or the discrepancy between mountain and valley temperatures in the same location), anomalies show the change in temperature from the mean.

This first plot shows the steady increase in temperature anomalies over the 136-year period, as indicated with a LOESS regression line. With the exception of 1998, the 10 warmest years in the period all have occurred since 2000. The year 2016 ranks as the warmest on record.

The second plot shows the same dataset broken down by month between each year, showing a gradual increase in temperature over the year-period, as well as unusual temperature fluctuations within each year closer to the year 2000 and beyond. Overall the mean atmospheric temperature has increased worldwide by approximately 1.5 degrees.

Why is such a minuscule increase of mean atmospheric temperature so significant? According to Mark Lynas (via an article in The Guardian), the author of _Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet_, such temperature increases can lead to quite damaging effects to the earth, some of which as follows.

**For a rise up to 2^o^C:**
- Arctic sea icecap disappears, leaving polar bears homeless and changing the Earth's energy balance dramatically as reflective ice is replaced during summer months by darker sea surface.
- Tropical coral reefs suffer severe and repeated bleaching episodes due to hotter ocean waters, killing off most coral and delivering a hammer blow to marine biodiversity.
- Droughts spread through the sub-tropics, accompanied by heatwaves and intense wildfires. Worst-hit are the Mediterranean, the south-west United States, southern Africa and Australia.

**From 2^o^C to 3^o^C:**
- Summer heatwaves such as that in Europe in 2003, which killed 30,000 people, become annual events. Extreme heat sees temperatures reaching the low 40s Celsius in southern England.
- Amazon rainforest crosses a "tipping point" where extreme heat and lower rainfall makes the forest unviable - much of it burns and is replaced by desert and savannah.
- Dissolved CO~2~ turns the oceans increasingly acidic, destroying remaining coral reefs and wiping out many species of plankton which are the basis of the marine food chain. - Several metres of sea level rise is now inevitable as the Greenland ice sheet disappears.

**From 3^o^C to 4^o^C:**
- Glacier and snow-melt in the world's mountain chains depletes freshwater flows to downstream cities and agricultural land. Most affected are California, Peru, Pakistan and China. Global food production is under threat as key breadbaskets in Europe, Asia and the United States suffer drought, and heatwaves outstrip the tolerance of crops.
- The Gulf Stream current declines significantly.
- Cooling in Europe is unlikely due to global warming, but oceanic changes alter weather patterns and lead to higher than average sea level rise in the eastern US and UK.

**From 5^o^C to 6^o^C:**
Global average temperatures are now hotter than for 50m years. The Arctic region sees temperatures rise much higher than average - up to 20^o^C - meaning the entire Arctic is now ice-free all year round. Most of the topics, sub-tropics and even lower mid-latitudes are too hot to be inhabitable. Sea level rise is now sufficiently rapid that coastal cities across the world are largely abandoned.

**6^o^C and above:**
Danger of "runaway warming", perhaps spurred by release of oceanic methane hydrates. Could the surface of the Earth become like Venus, entirely uninhabitable? Most sea life is dead. Human refuges now confined entirely to highland areas and the polar regions. Human population is drastically reduced. Perhaps 90% of species become extinct, rivaling the worst mass extinctions in the Earth's 4.5 billion-year history.[^35]

With this terrifying perspective, an increase of 1.5^o^C is no longer a mere minuscule rise, and should act as an alarm to political policymakers and captains of industry worldwide.

## Global Mean Sea Level | Years 1993 to 2017
http://www.cmar.csiro.au/sealevel/sl_data_cmar.html

One of the more pressing issues that will begin to affect billions of people living in coastal towns and cities worldwide is the rise of the sea-level due to climate change. Sea level can rise by two different mechanisms: Firstly, as the oceans warm due to an increasing global temperature, seawater expands—taking up more space in the ocean basin and causing a rise in water level. Secondly, the melting of ice over land, such as in Greenland or Antarctica, adds water to the ocean.

A mentioned previously, the rise in CO~2~ concentrations in the atmosphere are causing other damaging effects to the biosphere of the Earth. While there is data showing a disturbingly sharp rise in CO~2~ concentrations in the 20th century up to levels never before measured in Earth's history, does this rise actually correlate with other secondary effects of climate change, such as the mean sea level and air temperatures?

The following plots show that there is a clear linear correlation between both the Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) and CO~2~ data, and Land-Surface Air Temperatures and CO~2~ data. In both plots the linear rise in CO~2~ results in a linear rise in the other factor, strongly suggesting that CO~2~ is the causing factor in both scenarios.

The Pearson correlation estimate is `r toString(format(round(global_mean_sea_level_temperature_cor$estimate, 2), nsmall = 2))`, with a p-value of `r toString(format(global_mean_sea_level_temperature_cor$p.value, digits = 3, scientific = TRUE))`, which validates the reasonably strong correlation shown in the plot.

## Land Ice Mass | Years 2002 to 2016
https://sealevel-nexus.jpl.nasa.gov/data/ANT_mass_changes_Watkins053116.csv

Studies of snowfall and ice loss (‘mass budget’) in Antarctica and Greenland have been made using satellite measurements and estimates of the difference between net snowfall and ice loss. These confirm that both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are losing ice mass and contributing to sea level rise.[^23].

The measurements of ice mass has been completed by the twin satellites of the U.S./German Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or GRACE, launched on March 17, 2002. The greater an object's mass, the greater its gravitational pull. For example, the massive Rocky Mountains exert more gravitational pull than the flat plains of the Midwest. Humans don't notice the tiny difference, but these satellites do. While orbiting Earth, these satellites accelerate very slightly as they approach a massive feature, and slow down as they move away. Using this insight, these satellites are able to work in tandem to measure the on-going loss of ice mass.[^24]

The loss of ice mass at the two largest ice locations on Earth is a worrying sign of the effects of climate change. The loss of ice mass will directly cause a rise in sea levels worldwide, causing untold destruction to coastal towns and cities, as shown in the previous plot above.

Given that the land ice mass of both the Arctic and Antarctic regions is diminishing as an almost linear rate, it's possible cause can be investigated by 

The melting of the ice masses in Greenland and Antarctica is being caused by the increasing global atmospheric temperature, which in turn is being caused by the increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases such as CO~2~. Plotting ice mass loss for both regions against atmospheric CO~2~ concentrations over the same time period should show a strong correlation, which is demonstrated by the following 2 plots:

<div class="row" style="margin-top: 40px;"><div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1">
``` {r land_ice_mass_greenland_atmospheric_co2_plot, fig.width = 16, fig.height = 8, echo = FALSE}
# Display the Greenland ice mass plot object
multiplot(land_ice_mass_greenland_atmospheric_co2_plot,
          land_ice_mass_antarctica_atmospheric_co2_plot, cols = 2)
```
</div></div>

Both plots show a strong visual correlation between these two variables for each region, as an increase in _Atmospheric CO~2~_ appears to correlate with an increase in _Atmospheric CO~2~_. The Pearson correlation estimates and p-values for both datasets is shown below:

<div class="row"><div class="col-xs-6 col-xs-offset-3">
| Dataset | Estimate | P-value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Greenland | `r toString(format(round(land_ice_mass_greenland_atmospheric_co2_cor$estimate, 2), nsmall = 2))` | `r toString(format(land_ice_mass_greenland_atmospheric_co2_cor$p.value, digits = 3, scientific = TRUE))` |
| Antarctica | `r toString(format(round(land_ice_mass_antarctica_atmospheric_co2_cor$estimate, 2), nsmall = 2))` | `r toString(format(land_ice_mass_antarctica_atmospheric_co2_cor$p.value, digits = 3, scientific = TRUE))` |
</div></div>

These high estimate values and low p-values show that there is a strong correlation between the increase of ice mass loss and the rise of atmospheric CO~2~.

## Effects of Climate Change on Global Food Production from SRES Emissions and Socioeconomic Scenarios | Years 1970 to 2080
http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/downloads/data/crop-climate/crop-climate-effects-climate-global-food-production/crops-yield-changes-hadcm3-sres.xls

The future for the agricultural sector holds many challenges stemming from growing global populations, land degradation, and loss of cropland to urbanization. In this century climate change is one factor that could affect food production and availability in many parts of the world, particularly those most prone to drought and famine.[^27]

The purpose of this data set and the accompanying plots is to provide an assessment of potential climate change impacts on world staple crop production (wheat, rice, and maize) focusing yield changes based on multiple climate scenario runs. The data set assesses the implications of temperature and precipitation changes for world crop yields taking into account uncertainty in the level of climate change expected and physiological effects of carbon dioxide on plant growth.[^28] The projection model is the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, or SRES for short. There are 4 emissions scenarios which cover a wide range of the main demographic, economic and technological driving forces of future greenhouse gas and sulphur emissions. This dataset uses the A1 scenario, which models a future world of very rapid economic growth, global population that peaks in mid-century and declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies, as well as a continuation of the heavy use of fossil fuels.

### Wheat Yield Change From Baseline In 2050 Applying the SRES A1FI Scenario Yield Change To The 1990 Production

The SRES A1FI Scenario describes a future world of very rapid economic growth, global population that peaks in mid-century and declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies.[^33] 

The response to the SRES A1FI Scenario in the geographic plot below is largely positive. Countries in Australasia such as China, Malaysia, Japan, and Australia, show a positive change in wheat yield production, as does Canada. The largest positive change is by South American countries such as Bolivia and Argentina.

Countries that will be affected adversely in this scenario are Central American countries such as Mexico, Scandinavian countries such as Norway, Denmark, Sweden, European countries such as Poland and Austria, and Eastern Bloc countries such as Belarus. These countries show a negative change in wheat yield production.

### Rice Total Production Changes In 2050 Applying the SRES A1FI Scenario Yield Change to The 1990 Production

Similarly, to the wheat yield production projection under the SRES A1FI scenario, the rice total production changes is also largely positive, with the outputs from each country changing almost in the exact same way (positive or negative). This shows that the both wheat and rice yields will be affected the same way across the globe.

### Maize Total Production Changes In 2050 Applying the SRES A1FI Scenario Yield Change To The 1990 Production

Unlike wheat and rice yield production changes, maize production changes under the SRES A1FI scenario will differ substantially. North and South American countries, Western Europe countries, and Australia, will increase production. Scandinavian countries, Middle Eastern countries, the Russian Federation, and most of Africa except for the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic will suffer decreased production.

These future projections show that climate change effects under the SRES A1F1 scenario will not have a consistently negative effect across the globe. One reason for this is that ironically the increase in CO~2~ atmospheric concentrations on its own will actually be favoured by plant life, as plants require CO~2~ to grow. Secondary effects of climate change, such as an increase in global atmospheric temperatures and a rise in sea levels, may be the cause behind some countries experiencing a negative yield output.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

# Conclusion

Whether or not climate change is caused by human activities is a hugely contentious issue at present. From a scientific and data perspective, the evidence either strongly suggests or outright proves that CO~2~ concentration is rising sharply in the atmosphere, higher than it has ever been in recorded history, and higher than it is theorised the ecosystem can handle. The rise in CO~2~ will have devastating effects on the weather and sea levels, which will endanger all life in this planet. Rising global temperatures will push many species of vegetation and animal to extinction.

<div class="row"><div class="col-xs-6">
In the **Causes** section of this report, the atmospheric concentrations of various greenhouse gases were analysed and plotted on a time scale. Carbon Dioxide, or CO~2~, is considered the main cause of expansion of the "greenhouse effect", and human-caused CO~2~ emissions are the culprit. The data shows that from 1909 until present day, the concentration has continued to rise ceaselessly, and is currently at 400.83 ppm for the year 2015, which is higher than it has ever been in the past 800,000 years, judging from all the data collected.

The other greenhouse gases - Methane and Nitrous oxide - have also experienced a sharp increase in atmospheric concentrations due to human activity, and also contribute to the warming of the atmosphere.

Deforestation compounds the effects of climate change by reducing the number of trees which convert CO~2~ to O~2~ via photosynthesis. Despite reductions in the rate of deforestation in the last ten years, the Amazon Rainforest will be reduced by 40% by 2030 at the current rate.[^31] According to the plot below, from 1990 to 2015 approximately `r toString(comma_format()(total_deforestation_km2_1990_2015))` km^2^ of rainforest has been cleared.

Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, is a monetary measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced in a period, and is a good quantifiable measure of of human commercial activity. Plotting global yearly GDP levels against factors such as Atmospheric CO~2~ and Atmospheric Temperature show a strong linear correlation.

In the **Effects** section of this report, various factors are analysed which demonstrate the catastrophic effects of climate change. The mean estimates of global surface-air temperatures from 1880 to 2016 are plotted on a time scale, and show that the earth's temperature has been steadily increasing, which will have far-reaching consequences on the ecosystem and potentially human population areas.

The Global Mean Sea Level data was plotted on a time scale from 1880 to 2017, and shows an alarming linear sea level rise globally, which is the result of a warming atmosphere and a subsequent worldwide ice mass melting.

Investigating Ice Masses in more detail, the data gathered by NASA's GRACE satellites show that both the masses in Greenland and Antarctica have exhibited a disturbing declining trend from 2002 until 2016.

Climate change is a factor that could affect food production and availability in many parts of the world, particularly those most prone to drought and famine. Although there isn't any evidence to suggest that current climate change trends have has an immediate impact, the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, or SRES for short, have produced a projection model for food production impact by the year 2050.

According to the projection model, Central American countries such as Mexico, Scandinavian countries such as Norway, Denmark, Sweden, European countries such as Poland and Austria, and Eastern Bloc countries such as Belarus, will have adverse wheat and rice production effects from climate change. Scandinavian countries, Middle Eastern countries, the Russian Federation, and most of Africa except for the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic will suffer decreased production of maize.
